        <p>A tip on storing and preparing fresh mussels.<br>
        Mussels can be stored be stored for upto 3 days provided you do this correctly. Place them loose in a large bowl with a damp towel covering<br>
        them in the fridge. Discard any that don't close when touched, or smell fishy, they should smell like the sea/salty water. <br>
        Waste water may collect in the bottom of the bowl, discard and if the remoisten the towel if needed. To prepare, simply pull any beards,<br>
        left over rope from where they were grown, off.</p>

        <h3>Lets get cooking</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large pan with a little oil olive and a knob of butter, enough to cover the shalots you're about to chop, over <br>
            a medium heat. While the pan is warming chop your shalots and slice your garlic gloves.</li>
            <li>Gently fry your onions for a few mintues so the start to soften and then add your garlic.</li>
            <li>Once soft add in your wine and mussels, cover your pan, ideally with a lid that fits, if you don't have a lid foil will<br>
            work just fine, cook until most of the mussels are open.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat and pour in your double cream, season, and add you parsely, gently simmer for a couple of minutes stirring<br>
            occassionally.</li>
            <li>Plate up! Serve with your crusty baguettes, best to laddle into a bowl not skimping on the sauce! It's a good idea to have <br>
            a larger empty bowl ready for all the shells.</li>
        </ol>
