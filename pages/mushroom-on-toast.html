        <p>A perfect, quick and easy breakfast, or even an afternoon treat, that can be glammed up, and added to, or kept simple.<br>
        I'll mention a few of my favourite extras as optional, but you can literally add anything to these.<br>
        This receipe servers 1, but is very easy to scale up.</p>

            <li>A garlic glove,</li>
            <li>Bread to toast, sourdough works best, but any will do, one or two slices, depends how hungry you are!</li>
            <li>A hand full of chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Some Optional Ingredients You Could Include:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Lardons/Pancetta</li>
            <li>Cherry tomatoes</li>
            <li>Grated hard cheese, something like cheddar, or menchego works exceptionally well!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Lets Cook:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First off, lets warm up our pan with a little olive oil, to a medium to medium high heat. Be sure to be using regular olive oil and not<br>
            extra virgin and this isn't great to cook with. Whilst your pan is heating, you can dice you onions and slice your garlic.</li>
            <li>With your pan hot, chuck in your mushrooms whole, making sure they aren't stacked one on top of the other, but evenly distributed.<br>
            Leave to fry gernly for <strong>3-5mins</strong> undisturbed. If the pan is too hot, just turn it down a little.</li>
            <li>Once your mushrooms have started to lightly brown, add in the chopped onions and give the pan a quick toss before leaving for a<br>
            for a further <strong>3-5mins</strong>, depending what optional extras you plan to pop in, this is a good time, apart from the cheese,<br>
            that goes on at the end!</li>
            <li>Add a knob of butter and your sliced garlic to the pan, season to taste, toss, and leave for about another <strong>5mins</strong>,<br>
            or until the garlic starts to lightly brown</li>
            <li>In this time, pop in your bread to grill gently, or pop in the toaster.</li>
            <li>Once the toast is done, get ready to plate up. Pour the contents over you toast, now is the time to add the grated cheese if you wanted any,<br>
            and sprinkle with your fresh chopped parsley</li>
            <li>Most importantly of all, Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
